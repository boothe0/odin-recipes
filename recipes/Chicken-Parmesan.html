        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic
                (resealable freezer bags are good) on a solid, level surface.
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 
                thickness of 1/2 inch.
            </li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or 
                strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breats, evenly coating both sides.
            </li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl,set aside.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breat in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the 
                bread crumb mix, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast.
                Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes
            </li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins
                to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golend, about 2 minutes per side.
                It will finish cooking in the oven later.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tbsp tomato sauce.
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil,
                and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with
                1/2 tsp olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts
                are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant read thermometer
                instered into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.
            </li>
        </ol>
