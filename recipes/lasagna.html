        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook the sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic in a 
                <strong> Dutch </strong>oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
            <li>Stir in crush tomatoes, tomato sause, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
                basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. <strong>Simmer, covered, </strong>for about 1 1/2 hours
                stirring occasionally
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 
                8-10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9X13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles <strong>lengthwise</strong> over
                meat sause. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2
                cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese.
            </li>
            <li> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
                sticking, either <strong>spray foil with cooking spray</strong> or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for <strong>25 minutes</strong>. Remove the foil and bake for an <strong>additional 25 minutes</strong> </li>
